-----------------------------------------------Audacity NR explanation-----------------------------------------------

Audacity NR has 3 main parts: Noise profiling, decision making, filtering and frequency smoothing

This NR uses spectral method so all samples are taken in frequency domain

- Noise profiling: the approach they take for noise profiling is to take few noisy samples (minimum of 2 windows)
and **AVERAGE** them (Mean=(x1+x2+...+xn)/N) for each bin. That will be used as the noise profile. Since Audacity only 
uses one noise profile per time, this profile will be static until the user selects another profile.

                        Noise profile = Average of the input noisy samples

- Decision making: this block will decide if the current sample is noise or not for each bin. The output is a boolean 
array of size N, being N the amount of bins. The decision uses **3 input samples** (or 5), beign them 2 past and one 
present. Then the **MEDIAN** (or the second greatest) of these 3 or 5 samples is taken and used as the current sample 
for the decision. The decision is made by comparing the noise power of each bin from the noise profile and the current 
input power of each bin. There is a variable called **SENSITIVITY** used for tuning the decision. This variable is 
multiplyed by the noise profile. If the variable is high the number of samples detected as noise will increase.

                        if Input Power <= Noise Profile * Sensitivity   ->    Noisy Bin
                        else                                            ->   Speech Bin

- Filtering: Audacity implements an **fixed gain to filter only the bin samples detected as noise**, while the **non 
noise bin samples will have a gain of 0dB**. This gain can be 0 to -30dB. 
    
                        Noisy bin ->  Output gain = Chosen gain
                        Speech bin -> Output gain = Input bin 

- Frequency smoothing: after getting the gains for each bin, the process of frequency smoothing will be applied to the 
gains. The number of smoothing bands is variable. The smoothing process is to take the **gain of the neighbor bin in 
consideration** to one bin gain. For example, if the current noisy bin has the chosen gain of -18dB but the neighbor 
gains for the previous and next bin are 0dB because they are speech bins, the current noisy bin will not have -18dB as
its gain. The gain will be averaged between the 3 of them (if smoothing bands is 3). Then the gain will be (0-18+0)/3.
After this process then finally the input signal will be multiplied by the gain value.

                        Output = Input * (Gain(-1)+Gain(0)+Gain(1))/3
